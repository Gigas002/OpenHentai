## Tag description

`type` and `subtype` are probably not needed as description and taken from `master` tag. `notes` merged into localizable description. `gender` not used.
Tag value on `japanese` not used. `slave/master` tags have no bonds with description.

```json
{
    "description":
        [
            {
                "language": "en-US",
                "value": "This is localizable description, that includes formatted text and notes",
            },
            {
                "language": "ru-RU",
                "value": "Описание",
            }
        ]
